    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[When creating my website I was fortunate to have poeple around me who were able to help me with my colour selection and generl advice on getting to the point of slection and not just picking random colours because it "looked nice". At first I was just picking a colour I thought looked and then just putting it on website with out much concern to the actual styling and blending. I had not taken into account the fact that my colour selections had make the website look bland, boring but also hard to read. Thanks to decisions made earlier like using a colour combination website I was able to pick out a colour that not only I could be fine with using but also one that would be appealing to others]</p>
