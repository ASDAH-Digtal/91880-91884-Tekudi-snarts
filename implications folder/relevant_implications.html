    <h1>Relevant implications</h1>

    <h3>Relevant implication #1: [Aesthetics]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[The relevent implications for aesthetics is that we want the website to look appealing and well blended with all the colours mixing well together and also being easy to read]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[When creating my website I was fortunate to have poeple around me who were able to help me with my colour selection and generl advice on getting to the point of slection and not just picking random colours because it "looked nice". At first I was just picking a colour I thought looked and then just putting it on website with out much concern to the actual styling and blending. I had not taken into account the fact that my colour selections had make the website look bland, boring but also hard to read. Thanks to decisions made earlier like using a colour combination website I was able to pick out a colour that not only I could be fine with using but also one that would be appealing to others.]</p>

    <h3>Relevant implication #2: [Legal]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[When adding things that you didn't make or you don't own you run into a little bit of a legal problem. See because of a law called 'copyright' you are unable to just ad whatever you like your creation and in your onw way call it your creation for your own benefit. Such as if I was making an animated show and its called one piece but then to add attraction I out of no where add Batman, I would get in a lot of legal trouble because I am using someone else's creation for my own benefit as well as taking someone else's work and stealing which is bad. Your mom ever tell you stealing is bad kids? There is more to tthe laws behind it and what not but if you have questions you should be rich first because expensive lawyer is good lawyer]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[Well it is appropiate that I use One piece as an example because I used a copyrighted image of the popular graphic novel 'One Piece' in my website which as we learned is not allowed. I also had one from another popular manga named Naruto. After consulting my lawyer (Mr Malaitai) I learned of how much of a serious criminal I had become. However it was ok and settled after I removed the images and replaced them with other copyright free images from popular free image sight known as 'unsplash'. Malaitai informed me of a site namd unsplash that contained many images that I could use for free legally due to people uploading images to it and allowing others to use the images without any concerns. This allowed me to dodge a bullet and replace not only the two manga images but also any other images that I may have copyrighted. I also learned that I couldn't just take images from google because google images is unlike unsplash. Google just shows all the images it has stored from people uploading them no matter if you bought it or not. This can cause legal problems which is why we make sure to use unsplash as we know for a fact that it isn't copyrighted ]</p>

    <h3>Relevant implication #3: [Functionality]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[No one is perfect. This means that even if you are the most effcient coder on the planet you will still have moments where your code decides to become your ultron (lol copyright) or maybe just go and commit a few war crimes. The point is that it won't always work as intended and may be faulty. At points my code was not faulty, it was worse, an abomination and a sick cruel joke (life in a nutshell boys and girls). At times pages woulnd't load correctly or would be missing things or just, not work. So when we think about functionality we have to make sure of the fact that every single link works and also does as its told. We should make sure that pages load and that everything thats supposed to work, works.  ]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[Man was this one an absolute doosy for me. I constantly had things breaking on me and not working, it felt that I was fixing often as links wouldn't work or buttons would be in the wrong place just to spite me for briging it into this world. There isn't much to say other than I fixed it and now it works yay. But thats how it really was, just like writing this parahraph it was a very slow and long task that took enough will power to power Auckland for a year but hey. Thats what its all about man, you keep your head glued to that screen and pray for the best. After everything works you can move onto your next big life choice. Maybe also make one that makes sense, finding a partner, improving your health or maybe even just studying because I couldv'e cured cancer with the amount of time I spent fixing this stupid code made by an equally as stupid person.]</p>
